# Solana Test Environment with Google BigTable Emulator

This repository contains a Docker-based setup for a Solana test environment integrated with a Google BigTable emulator. The environment includes two main services:

1. **BigTable Emulator**: Simulates Google BigTable for local testing without needing to interact with Google Cloud.
2. **Solana Test Validator**: A custom Solana Warehouse test node that generates a local network and simulates transactions.

The setup is ideal for development and testing of Solana applications that require interaction with BigTable for data storage and analysis.

## Requirements

- Docker
- Docker Compose

## Getting Started

### Clone the Repository

First, clone this repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/solana-bigtable-integration.git
cd solana-bigtable-integration
```

# Build and Run the Containers

Run the following command to build and start the containers using Docker Compose:

```bash
docker compose build
docker compose up
```

This command builds the services defined in docker-compose.yml and starts the containers. Hereâ€™s what each service does:

1. **bigtable-emulator**: Runs the Google BigTable emulator and exposes it on port 8086.
2. **solana-test-validator**: Builds from a Dockerfile located in the validator/ directory. It depends on the BigTable emulator and starts once the emulator is up and running. It also sets up environment variables required for the Solana node to interact with the BigTable emulator.

# Environment Variables

The containers use the following environment variables:

1. **BIGTABLE_EMULATOR_HOST**: Points to the BigTable emulator service for integration.
2. **GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS**: A placeholder for Google credentials. Not required for the emulator but set for compatibility.
