# Solana Test Environment with Google BigTable Emulator

This repository contains a Docker-based setup for a Solana test environment integrated with a Google BigTable emulator. The environment includes 4 main services:

1. **BigTable Emulator**: Simulates Google BigTable for local testing without needing to interact with Google Cloud.
2. **Solana Test Validator**: A custom Solana Warehouse test node that generates a local network and simulates transactions while uploading them to the BigTable emulator.
3. **Syncer**: A custom service that reads from the BigTable emulator and writes data to sequencefiles locally.
4. **HBase**: A Hadoop database that can be used to import the sequencefiles generated by the Syncer.
5. **Solana Lite RPC**: A Solana RPC server that can be used to query the Solana network from both BigTable and HBase.

The setup is ideal for development and testing of migration Solana from Google BigTable to HBase. Cheack each service's folder for more information.

# End to End Usage Flow

1. Start the BigTable Emulator
2. Start the Solana Test Validator
3. Let the Solana Test Validator run for a while to generate transactions. It should reach at least one Finalized Slot in order to have data in BigTable.
4. Start the Syncer service
5. Start the HBase service, create the tables and import the sequencefiles generated by the Syncer (see the HBase service readme for more information)
6. Start the Solana Lite RPC service and query the node for data (see the Solana Lite RPC service readme for more information)
